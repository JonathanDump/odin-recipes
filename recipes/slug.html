                    <h3> Description</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Let me say from the beginning, that this is not a decision that I would relish: To eat slugs
                            or
                            starve to death. I’ve eaten them before, and I hope I never have to repeat that experience.
                            But
                            they will pass for food in a pinch. Terrestrial slugs and snails (found on land, not in the
                            sea)
                            are generally safe for human consumption, always after a thorough cooking. And their
                            nutritional
                            value certainly justifies the effort of collecting and preparing them. These critters have
                            about
                            90 calories per 100 grams of “meat,” which is high in protein (12 to 16 percent) and rich in
                            minerals. It’s a little hard to consider them food though, when you realize that their
                            favorite
                            meal is scat.</p>
